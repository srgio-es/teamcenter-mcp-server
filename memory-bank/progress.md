## Current Status

### Project Status: **Functional Prototype**

The Teamcenter MCP Server is currently in a functional prototype state. It implements the core functionality required to interact with Teamcenter through the MCP protocol, including:

- Authentication with Teamcenter
- Searching and retrieving items
- Creating and updating items
- Accessing Teamcenter resources

The server is stable for basic operations but lacks some advanced features and optimizations. It is suitable for demonstration and initial use cases but may require enhancements for production use with complex Teamcenter instances.

### Development Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| MCP Server | Complete | Core functionality implemented |
| Authentication | Complete | Login, session management working |
| Item Operations | Complete | Search, retrieve, create, update working |
| Resource Access | Complete | Item types, item details, search working |
| Error Handling | Partial | Basic error handling in place, needs refinement |
| Documentation | Complete | README and Memory Bank created |
| Testing | Not Started | No automated tests yet |
| Performance | Basic | No optimizations implemented yet |

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues

1. **Type Safety**:
   - Some Teamcenter API responses use `any` types
   - This reduces type safety and may lead to runtime errors
   - Plan: Create more specific type definitions

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Some error cases may not be handled specifically
   - Generic error messages may not be helpful for troubleshooting
   - Plan: Add more granular error handling

3. **Session Management**:
   - Sessions may expire during long periods of inactivity
   - No automatic session renewal mechanism
   - Plan: Implement session monitoring and renewal

4. **~~Browser Compatibility~~ (FIXED)**:
   - ~~Browser-specific code causing errors in Node.js environment~~
   - ~~References to document and window objects not available in Node.js~~
   - ~~Fixed: Added environment detection and conditional code execution~~

### Functional Limitations

1. **Search Capabilities**:
   - Limited to basic name-based searches
   - No support for complex query criteria
   - Plan: Enhance search capabilities with more filters

2. **Item Creation**:
   - Limited to basic item properties
   - No support for relationships or complex structures
   - Plan: Extend item creation to support more complex scenarios

3. **Response Format**:
   - Raw JSON responses may be difficult to interpret
   - No contextual information or guidance
   - Plan: Improve response formatting for better readability

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach (v0.1)

The initial approach focused on creating a minimal viable product (MVP) that could:

1. Authenticate with Teamcenter
2. Perform basic item operations
3. Expose resources through MCP

Key decisions:
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement a simple SOA client
- Focus on core functionality first

### Current Approach (v1.0)

The current approach has evolved to:

1. Provide a more comprehensive set of Teamcenter operations
2. Improve error handling and robustness
3. Add better documentation and examples
4. Ensure cross-environment compatibility

Key changes:
- Added more Teamcenter operations
- Improved error handling with standardized responses
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Enhanced configuration options
- Fixed browser compatibility issues for Node.js environment

### Future Direction (v2.0)

The planned future direction includes:

1. Adding advanced Teamcenter features
2. Improving user experience
3. Enhancing security and performance

Planned changes:
- Support for workflows and document management
- Enhanced response formatting
- Caching and performance optimizations
- More comprehensive testing
