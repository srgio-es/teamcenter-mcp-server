## Current Status

### Project Status: **Functional Implementation with Command Pattern Refactoring**

The Teamcenter MCP Server is currently in a functional implementation state with a significant refactoring to use the Command pattern. It implements the core functionality required to interact with Teamcenter through the MCP protocol, including:

- Authentication with Teamcenter
- Searching and retrieving items
- Creating and updating items
- Accessing Teamcenter resources
- Session management
- User-specific operations (user-owned items, recently created items, favorites, user properties)
- Error handling with specific error types and context
- Automated testing with Jest
- Continuous integration with GitHub Actions

The recent refactoring to use the Command pattern has significantly improved code organization, maintainability, and testability. Each operation is now implemented as a separate command class, making the code more modular and easier to extend.

The server is stable for basic operations but lacks some advanced features and optimizations. It is suitable for demonstration and initial use cases but may require enhancements for production use with complex Teamcenter instances.

### Development Status

| Error Handling | Complete | Standardized error handling with specific error types |
| Documentation | Complete | README, Memory Bank, and testing docs created |
| Code Organization | Complete | Command pattern implemented with logical directory structure |
| Testing | In Progress | Basic tests implemented, more coverage needed |
| CI/CD | In Progress | Basic CI pipeline implemented, CD needed |
| Performance | Basic | No optimizations implemented yet |

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues

1. **Type Safety**:
   - Some Teamcenter API responses use `any` types
   - This reduces type safety and may lead to runtime errors
   - Plan: Create more specific type definitions
   - Status: Improved with TCLoginResponse interface and other typed interfaces

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Some error cases may not be handled specifically
   - Generic error messages may not be helpful for troubleshooting
   - Plan: Add more granular error handling
   - Status: Significantly improved with AppError class, error types, and standardized error responses

3. **Session Management**:
   - Sessions may expire during long periods of inactivity
   - No automatic session renewal mechanism
   - Plan: Implement session monitoring and renewal
   - Status: Improved cookie-based session handling

4. **~~Browser Compatibility~~ (FIXED)**:
   - ~~Browser-specific code causing errors in Node.js environment~~
   - ~~References to document and window objects not available in Node.js~~
   - ~~Fixed: Added environment detection and conditional code execution~~
   - Status: Fully resolved with environment-aware code

5. **Test Coverage**:
   - Limited test coverage for some components
   - No tests for the new command classes
   - No integration tests for key workflows
   - Plan: Add more comprehensive tests
   - Status: Basic test infrastructure in place, more tests needed

### Functional Limitations

1. **Search Capabilities**:
   - Limited to basic name-based searches
   - No support for complex query criteria
   - Plan: Enhance search capabilities with more filters
   - Status: Added support for type filtering and result limits

2. **Item Creation**:
   - Limited to basic item properties
   - No support for relationships or complex structures
   - Plan: Extend item creation to support more complex scenarios
   - Status: Added support for custom properties

3. **Response Format**:
   - Raw JSON responses may be difficult to interpret
   - No contextual information or guidance
   - Plan: Improve response formatting for better readability
   - Status: Added consistent error formatting and response structure
