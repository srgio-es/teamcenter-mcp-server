# Project Brief: Teamcenter MCP Server

## Project Overview
The Teamcenter MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Teamcenter PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) using its REST API. It enables Claude to interact directly with Teamcenter data, allowing users to search, retrieve, create, and update items in their Teamcenter instance without leaving the Claude interface.

## Core Requirements

1. **Seamless Integration**: Provide a seamless integration between Claude and Teamcenter PLM systems.

2. **Authentication**: Support secure authentication with Teamcenter using credentials.

3. **Data Access**: Enable access to Teamcenter data through standardized MCP resources and tools.

4. **Item Management**: Allow users to search, retrieve, create, and update Teamcenter items.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API failures and invalid requests.

6. **Security**: Ensure secure handling of credentials and data.

## Project Goals

1. **Simplify PLM Interaction**: Make it easier for users to interact with complex PLM data through natural language.

2. **Enhance Productivity**: Reduce context switching between Claude and Teamcenter.

3. **Standardize Access**: Provide a standardized way to access Teamcenter data through the MCP protocol.

4. **Extensibility**: Create a foundation that can be extended to support additional Teamcenter functionality.

## Success Criteria

1. Users can successfully authenticate with their Teamcenter instance.

2. Users can search for and retrieve items from Teamcenter.

3. Users can create and update items in Teamcenter.

4. The server handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages.

5. The server follows MCP standards for resource and tool definitions.

## Constraints

1. The server must operate within the MCP protocol specifications.

2. The server must be compatible with the Teamcenter REST API.

3. The server must handle authentication securely.

4. The server must be performant and handle Teamcenter API rate limits appropriately.

## Stakeholders

1. **End Users**: Engineers, designers, and other Teamcenter users who want to interact with their PLM data through Claude.

2. **Administrators**: IT personnel responsible for setting up and maintaining the integration.

3. **Developers**: Engineers responsible for extending and maintaining the server code.
