   - Trade-offs: Adds some complexity but significantly improves code structure
   - Benefits: Each command is self-contained, easier to test, and easier to extend

2. **Singleton Service Pattern**:
   - Decision: Implement teamcenterService as a singleton
   - Rationale: Maintains a single session with Teamcenter, simplifies state management
   - Trade-offs: Less flexibility for multiple sessions, but better resource utilization

3. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Decision: Use standardized TCResponse objects with error information and AppError class with specific error types
   - Rationale: Provides consistent error handling across the application with better categorization
   - Trade-offs: Adds some overhead but improves maintainability and debugging

4. **Configuration Approach**:
   - Decision: Use environment variables for configuration
   - Rationale: Separates configuration from code, supports different environments
   - Trade-offs: Requires proper environment setup but improves security

5. **Request Tracing**:
   - Decision: Add unique request IDs to all API calls
   - Rationale: Improves traceability and debugging
   - Trade-offs: Adds some overhead but significantly improves troubleshooting

6. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Decision: Use Jest with TypeScript for testing
   - Rationale: Provides a modern testing framework with good TypeScript support
   - Trade-offs: Requires additional configuration for ESM support but offers better developer experience

7. **CI/CD Approach**:
   - Decision: Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Rationale: Tight integration with GitHub, easy to configure, and free for public repositories
   - Trade-offs: Limited to GitHub ecosystem but sufficient for project needs

### Technical Debt

1. **Type Definitions**:
   - Some Teamcenter API responses use `any` types
   - Need to create more specific type definitions
   - Plan to refine types as the API usage patterns become clearer
   - Consider generating types from Teamcenter API documentation
   - Added TCLoginResponse interface for login response structure

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Some error cases may not be handled specifically
   - Need to add more granular error handling
   - Plan to improve based on real-world usage patterns
   - Standardize error codes across the application

3. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Initial tests implemented but coverage is not comprehensive
   - Need to add tests for the new command classes
   - Need to add more tests for edge cases and error scenarios
   - Plan to implement integration tests with mock Teamcenter server
   - Add unit tests for utility functions and core logic

4. **Environment Compatibility**:
   - Some parts of the code still assume browser capabilities
   - Need to fully audit for browser-specific APIs
   - Plan to create proper environment abstractions
   - Ensure consistent behavior across Node.js versions
   - Added environment detection for document and window objects

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization

1. **Command Pattern**:
   - Each operation is implemented as a separate command class
   - Commands are organized into logical directories (auth, item, search, user, session)
   - All commands implement the Command interface
   - Most commands extend the BaseCommand abstract class
   - Commands are executed by a CommandExecutor

2. **Module Structure**:
   - Each module has a single responsibility
   - Related functionality is grouped together
   - Interfaces are defined in types.ts

3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Prefix Teamcenter-related types with TC (e.g., TCObject, TCResponse)
   - Use descriptive names for functions and variables
   - Follow camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for types and classes
   - Command classes are named with the action they perform (e.g., LoginCommand, SearchItemsCommand)

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Use try/catch blocks for all external API calls
   - Return standardized TCResponse objects with error information
   - Use AppError class with specific error types for better categorization
   - Log errors for debugging but don't expose sensitive information

5. **Testing Patterns**:
   - Use descriptive test names following the pattern "should [expected behavior]"
   - Group related tests using describe blocks
   - Mock external dependencies to isolate the code being tested
   - Test both success and error cases

### API Design Principles

1. **Consistency**:
   - All service methods follow the same pattern
   - All methods return TCResponse objects
   - All errors are handled consistently
   - All requests are traced with unique IDs

2. **Simplicity**:
   - Expose simplified interfaces to complex Teamcenter operations
   - Hide implementation details behind clean interfaces
   - Provide sensible defaults for optional parameters

3. **Robustness**:
   - Validate inputs before making API calls
   - Handle edge cases and error conditions
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log all requests and responses for traceability

4. **Testability**:
   - Design code to be easily testable
   - Use dependency injection where appropriate
   - Export classes and functions for testing
   - Use interfaces for better mocking
