# Active Context: Teamcenter MCP Server

## Current Work Focus

The Teamcenter MCP Server is currently in a functional state with core features implemented. The server successfully:

1. Authenticates with Teamcenter using provided credentials
2. Exposes Teamcenter resources through MCP resource endpoints
3. Provides tools for searching, retrieving, creating, and updating Teamcenter items
4. Handles errors and edge cases appropriately

The current focus is on:

1. **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation for the server, including this Memory Bank
2. **Testing**: Ensuring all functionality works as expected with real Teamcenter instances
3. **Error Handling**: Improving error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **User Experience**: Refining the response formats to be more user-friendly

   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add audit logging for security events

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Singleton Service Pattern**:
   - Decision: Implement teamcenterService as a singleton
   - Rationale: Maintains a single session with Teamcenter, simplifies state management
   - Trade-offs: Less flexibility for multiple sessions, but better resource utilization

2. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Decision: Use standardized TCResponse objects with error information
   - Rationale: Provides consistent error handling across the application
   - Trade-offs: Adds some overhead but improves maintainability

3. **Configuration Approach**:
   - Decision: Use environment variables for configuration
   - Rationale: Separates configuration from code, supports different environments
   - Trade-offs: Requires proper environment setup but improves security

### Technical Debt

1. **Type Definitions**:
   - Some Teamcenter API responses use `any` types
   - Need to create more specific type definitions
   - Plan to refine types as the API usage patterns become clearer
   - Consider generating types from Teamcenter API documentation
   - Added TCLoginResponse interface for login response structure

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Some error cases may not be handled specifically
   - Need to add more granular error handling
   - Plan to improve based on real-world usage patterns
   - Standardize error codes across the application

3. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Limited automated tests
   - Need to add more comprehensive test coverage
   - Plan to implement integration tests with mock Teamcenter server
   - Add unit tests for utility functions and core logic

4. **Environment Compatibility**:
   - Some parts of the code still assume browser capabilities
   - Need to fully audit for browser-specific APIs
   - Plan to create proper environment abstractions
   - Ensure consistent behavior across Node.js versions
   - Added environment detection for document and window objects

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization

1. **Module Structure**:
   - Each module has a single responsibility
   - Related functionality is grouped together
   - Interfaces are defined in types.ts

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Prefix Teamcenter-related types with TC (e.g., TCObject, TCResponse)
   - Use descriptive names for functions and variables
   - Follow camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for types and classes

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Use try/catch blocks for all external API calls
   - Return standardized TCResponse objects with error information
   - Log errors for debugging but don't expose sensitive information

### API Design Principles

1. **Consistency**:
   - All service methods follow the same pattern
   - All methods return TCResponse objects
   - All errors are handled consistently

2. **Simplicity**:
   - Expose simplified interfaces to complex Teamcenter operations
   - Hide implementation details behind clean interfaces
   - Provide sensible defaults for optional parameters

3. **Robustness**:
   - Validate inputs before making API calls
   - Handle edge cases and error conditions
   - Provide meaningful error messages

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights

1. **Teamcenter API Complexity**:
   - Teamcenter's SOA API has a complex structure
   - Operations are grouped by service and operation names
   - Request/response formats vary significantly between operations
   - Response parsing requires service and operation-specific handling

2. **MCP Protocol Considerations**:
   - MCP resources must be representable as UTF-8 text
   - Tool inputs must be JSON-serializable
   - Error handling must be mapped to MCP error codes

3. **Authentication Challenges**:
   - Teamcenter uses session-based authentication
   - Sessions expire after periods of inactivity
   - Need to handle re-authentication gracefully
   - Session cookies must be properly managed for persistent authentication

4. **Environment Compatibility**:
   - Node.js and browser environments have different APIs
   - Browser-specific objects like document and window are not available in Node.js
   - Need to check for environment type before using environment-specific APIs
   - Fetch API implementation differs between environments

### Process Improvements

1. **Documentation First**:
   - Creating this Memory Bank has helped clarify the project structure
   - Documentation should be updated as code changes
   - Clear documentation reduces onboarding time for new developers

2. **Incremental Development**:
   - Start with core functionality and expand
   - Test each component thoroughly before moving on
   - Get feedback early and often

3. **Error Handling Focus**:
   - Prioritize robust error handling from the start
   - Error messages should be user-friendly
   - Errors should provide actionable information
