# Active Context: Teamcenter MCP Server

## Current Work Focus

The Teamcenter MCP Server is currently in a functional state with core features implemented. The server successfully:

1. Authenticates with Teamcenter using provided credentials
2. Exposes Teamcenter resources through MCP resource endpoints
3. Provides tools for searching, retrieving, creating, and updating Teamcenter items
4. Handles errors and edge cases appropriately
5. Supports user-specific operations (user-owned items, recently created items, favorites)
6. Provides session management and user information retrieval

The current focus is on:

1. **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation for the server, including this Memory Bank
2. **Testing**: Implementing automated tests for all functionality with Jest
3. **CI/CD**: Setting up GitHub Actions for continuous integration
4. **Error Handling**: Improving error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **User Experience**: Refining the response formats to be more user-friendly

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Singleton Service Pattern**:
   - Decision: Implement teamcenterService as a singleton
   - Rationale: Maintains a single session with Teamcenter, simplifies state management
   - Trade-offs: Less flexibility for multiple sessions, but better resource utilization

2. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Decision: Use standardized TCResponse objects with error information and AppError class with specific error types
   - Rationale: Provides consistent error handling across the application with better categorization
   - Trade-offs: Adds some overhead but improves maintainability and debugging

3. **Configuration Approach**:
   - Decision: Use environment variables for configuration
   - Rationale: Separates configuration from code, supports different environments
   - Trade-offs: Requires proper environment setup but improves security

4. **Request Tracing**:
   - Decision: Add unique request IDs to all API calls
   - Rationale: Improves traceability and debugging
   - Trade-offs: Adds some overhead but significantly improves troubleshooting

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Decision: Use Jest with TypeScript for testing
   - Rationale: Provides a modern testing framework with good TypeScript support
   - Trade-offs: Requires additional configuration for ESM support but offers better developer experience

6. **CI/CD Approach**:
   - Decision: Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Rationale: Tight integration with GitHub, easy to configure, and free for public repositories
   - Trade-offs: Limited to GitHub ecosystem but sufficient for project needs

### Technical Debt

1. **Type Definitions**:
   - Some Teamcenter API responses use `any` types
   - Need to create more specific type definitions
   - Plan to refine types as the API usage patterns become clearer
   - Consider generating types from Teamcenter API documentation
   - Added TCLoginResponse interface for login response structure

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Some error cases may not be handled specifically
   - Need to add more granular error handling
   - Plan to improve based on real-world usage patterns
   - Standardize error codes across the application

3. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Initial tests implemented but coverage is not comprehensive
   - Need to add more tests for edge cases and error scenarios
   - Plan to implement integration tests with mock Teamcenter server
   - Add unit tests for utility functions and core logic

4. **Environment Compatibility**:
   - Some parts of the code still assume browser capabilities
   - Need to fully audit for browser-specific APIs
   - Plan to create proper environment abstractions
   - Ensure consistent behavior across Node.js versions
   - Added environment detection for document and window objects

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization

1. **Module Structure**:
   - Each module has a single responsibility
   - Related functionality is grouped together
   - Interfaces are defined in types.ts

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Prefix Teamcenter-related types with TC (e.g., TCObject, TCResponse)
   - Use descriptive names for functions and variables
   - Follow camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for types and classes

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Use try/catch blocks for all external API calls
   - Return standardized TCResponse objects with error information
   - Use AppError class with specific error types for better categorization
   - Log errors for debugging but don't expose sensitive information

4. **Testing Patterns**:
   - Use descriptive test names following the pattern "should [expected behavior]"
   - Group related tests using describe blocks
   - Mock external dependencies to isolate the code being tested
   - Test both success and error cases

### API Design Principles

1. **Consistency**:
   - All service methods follow the same pattern
   - All methods return TCResponse objects
   - All errors are handled consistently
   - All requests are traced with unique IDs

2. **Simplicity**:
   - Expose simplified interfaces to complex Teamcenter operations
   - Hide implementation details behind clean interfaces
   - Provide sensible defaults for optional parameters

3. **Robustness**:
   - Validate inputs before making API calls
   - Handle edge cases and error conditions
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log all requests and responses for traceability

4. **Testability**:
   - Design code to be easily testable
   - Use dependency injection where appropriate
   - Export classes and functions for testing
   - Use interfaces for better mocking

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights

1. **Teamcenter API Complexity**:
   - Teamcenter's SOA API has a complex structure
   - Operations are grouped by service and operation names
   - Request/response formats vary significantly between operations
   - Response parsing requires service and operation-specific handling

2. **MCP Protocol Considerations**:
   - MCP resources must be representable as UTF-8 text
   - Tool inputs must be JSON-serializable
   - Error handling must be mapped to MCP error codes
   - Request tracing is essential for debugging

3. **Authentication Challenges**:
   - Teamcenter uses session-based authentication
   - Sessions expire after periods of inactivity
   - Need to handle re-authentication gracefully
   - Session cookies must be properly managed for persistent authentication

4. **Environment Compatibility**:
   - Node.js and browser environments have different APIs
   - Browser-specific objects like document and window are not available in Node.js
   - Need to check for environment type before using environment-specific APIs
   - Fetch API implementation differs between environments

5. **Testing in ESM Environment**:
   - Jest requires special configuration for ESM support
   - Need to use the --experimental-vm-modules flag
   - Import mocking works differently in ESM
   - TypeScript paths need to be mapped correctly

### Process Improvements

1. **Documentation First**:
   - Creating this Memory Bank has helped clarify the project structure
   - Documentation should be updated as code changes
   - Clear documentation reduces onboarding time for new developers

2. **Incremental Development**:
   - Start with core functionality and expand
   - Test each component thoroughly before moving on
   - Get feedback early and often

3. **Error Handling Focus**:
   - Prioritize robust error handling from the start
   - Error messages should be user-friendly
   - Errors should provide actionable information
   - Error categorization improves debugging and analysis

4. **Test-Driven Development**:
   - Consider writing tests before implementing new features
   - Tests help clarify requirements and expected behavior
   - Tests provide confidence when making changes
   - Continuous testing catches issues early
