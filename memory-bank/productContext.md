# Product Context: Teamcenter MCP Server

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems like Teamcenter contain critical engineering and product data that is essential for many business processes. However, accessing and working with this data typically requires:

1. Specialized knowledge of Teamcenter's complex interface
2. Context switching between different applications
3. Understanding of PLM-specific terminology and data structures
4. Time-consuming navigation through multiple screens and menus

This creates friction for users who need to quickly access or manipulate PLM data while working with Claude, resulting in reduced productivity and user frustration.

### Solution
The Teamcenter MCP Server bridges this gap by enabling direct interaction with Teamcenter data through Claude's natural language interface. By implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it allows Claude to:

1. Search for items in Teamcenter
2. Retrieve detailed information about specific items
3. Create new items in Teamcenter
4. Update existing items with new properties
5. Access various Teamcenter resources through standardized URIs

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. **Authentication**: The user configures their Teamcenter credentials in the MCP settings file. The server authenticates with Teamcenter on startup. // THIS IS NOT RIGHT. AUTHENTICATION IS PERFORMED WITH THE TOOL LOGIN. Logout is performed with the tool LOGOUT.

2. **Resource Access**: Users can request Teamcenter resources through Claude using the `access_mcp_resource` command with URIs like:
   - `teamcenter://item-types` - List available item types
   - `teamcenter://items/{id}` - Get details of a specific item
   - `teamcenter://search/{query}` - Search for items

3. **Tool Usage**: Users can perform actions in Teamcenter through Claude using the `use_mcp_tool` command with tools like:
   - `search_items` - Search for items with optional filtering // NOT WORKING
   - `get_item` - Retrieve detailed information about an item // NOT WORKING
   - `create_item` - Create a new item in Teamcenter  // NOT WORKING
   - `update_item` - Update properties of an existing item  // NOT WORKING
   - `get_item_types` - List available item types  // NOT WORKING

4. **Results Presentation**: Claude presents the results in a user-friendly format, explaining the data and offering suggestions for next steps.

### Integration Points

1. **Teamcenter REST API**: The server communicates with Teamcenter using its REST API, translating MCP requests into appropriate API calls.

2. **MCP Protocol**: The server implements the MCP protocol to expose Teamcenter functionality to Claude.

3. **Claude Interface**: Users interact with the server through Claude's interface using MCP commands.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: Users should be able to access Teamcenter data with simple, natural language requests.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: Claude should understand the context of Teamcenter data and help users interpret it.

3. **Efficiency**: Users should be able to accomplish Teamcenter tasks faster through Claude than through the native Teamcenter interface.

4. **Guidance**: Claude should guide users through complex Teamcenter operations, suggesting next steps and explaining results.

5. **Error Recovery**: When errors occur, Claude should explain the issue clearly and suggest solutions.

## Target Users

1. **Engineers and Designers**: Professionals who need to access and update product data in Teamcenter as part of their design and engineering workflows.

2. **Project Managers**: Team leaders who need to track and update product information without deep Teamcenter expertise.

3. **Cross-functional Team Members**: Stakeholders from various departments who need occasional access to PLM data without extensive training.

4. **PLM Administrators**: System administrators who can leverage Claude to help manage and troubleshoot Teamcenter data.

## Value Proposition

1. **Time Savings**: Reduce the time spent navigating Teamcenter's complex interface.

2. **Reduced Training**: Lower the barrier to entry for working with PLM data.

3. **Improved Data Access**: Make critical product information more accessible across the organization.

4. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Enable better cross-functional collaboration around product data.

5. **Streamlined Workflows**: Integrate PLM data access into natural language workflows with Claude.
